Automation Scripting Essentials

This is a collection of scripts in various languages that illustrate how to 
accomplish the tasks that I encounter most often when automating something.

The tasks can be roughly categorized as follows:

1. Parsing command-line options
2. Reading files
3. Logging
4. Data Structures
5. Regular Expressions

The scripting languages that I am including so far are:

1. Bash
2. Perl
3. Python
